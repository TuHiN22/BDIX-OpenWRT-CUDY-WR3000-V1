# BDIX-OpenWRT-CUDY-WR3000-V1
BDIX bypass is widely used in Bangladesh to enhance connectivity. This guide shows how to set up a Socks5 proxy on CUDY WR3000 V1 Router running OpenWRT version 24.10.2 (r28739-d9340319c6)  using Redsocks for seamless BDIX access.

BDIX bypass is becoming increasingly popular in Bangladesh, especially in both rural and urban areas. Socks5 is one of the most widely used proxy protocols here.

### Can we use a Socks5 proxy on an OpenWRT router?
Yes! We can configure a Socks5 proxy on an OpenWRT router using **Redsocks**. I have customized Redsocks as **BDIX**, specifically for BDIX proxy users. However, there are very few tutorials available on setting up a Socks5 proxy on an OpenWRT router.

This tutorial will guide you through the installation and configuration process, making it easy to set up on your CUDY-WR3000-V1 running OpenWRT router.

## üöÄ BDIX Proxy Service Installation

Run the following command to install the BDIX proxy extension automatically:

```
cd /tmp && wget https://github.com/TuHiN22/BDIX-OpenWRT-CUDY-WR3000-V1/raw/main/install.sh && chmod +x install.sh && clear && sh install.sh && rm install.sh
```

Just run it and wait for the process to complete. Enjoy!
